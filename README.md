This java project was built to take in a given sentence, using the local static functions, provide support
for returning the longest and shortest words in the sentence. The assumptions and expectations are listed as such:

- Word and length are returned as a key/value pair
- Word comparisons are case insensitive and will return lowercase
- In the case of max/min words of equal length, the first instance of an equally sized word will return
- Numbers are ignored, only letters "a-z" are considered
- Whitespace and punctuation is ignored
- Words can theoretically be as large as max int

Running:
In the interest of timely delivery of this exercise, running from within IntelliJ (or presumably Eclipse) is preferred

Once you've cloned the project, open it in IntelliJ for the most direct method of running and viewing the results.

Compile the Main.java class and subsequently run the MainTest.java from the upper right corner of the IDE, again,
from within IntelliJ.

View output in the console window of the IDE.  Additional test cases can be added or modified inside the MainTest.java
file, contained within the src directory.
